The project requires Android Studio installed, Java installed, latest SDK if possible, gradle should be initalized (it's usually prompting you the first time you open the project)

The main build run is MainActivity.java, that's the one having the main function to run the application.

I used the default Pixel 3A for testing.

Make sure to disable touchscreen on windows (I did it from Device Manager > Human Interface Devices > HID-compliant touch screen

When filtering budget dates remember to set a day back and a day forward from your planned view (if planning to see budgets on the 07/05/2024 and 08/05/2024 then you need to filter by 06/05/2024 and 09/05/2024) (something I'm still wondering how to fix, but no more time)

The task on click listener is sometimes buggy, which means you might have to go to a random date and back to the date you wanted to refresh tasks and get them to work. (something I'm still wondering how to fix, but no more time)

Make sure you have notifications enabled in the android emulator, and that you allow "Dissertation" App to send notifications. Sometimes you enable them and they still don't work unless you manually do them (I only had this issue on the laptop, while at City, testing right now as I am typing this). Go into the System Settings > Notifications > App Notifications > tick ON for "Dissertation"

The weather alarm will be sent 5 seconds and then every 3 seconds for every subsequent time where probability of precipitation is high (>= 70)

The Folder Structure is the default. Unzip the file and open the "Dissertation" in your android studio directly

Only changes to the readme, the code is NOT touched since the submission. (Can be seen on the date of the upload, only this readme file will be recent)

I allocated 5GB of RAM because Android Studio seems to be very heavy and buggy without it. Even right now my laptop has black screens sometimes when interacting with the UI. Even outside of my application I have issues like this. I just want to state that I have none of these problems on my home computer (it is a fair bit more powerful) so I don't think it's the code's problem as much as it is the IDE being too heavy on certain computers.

The main branch is: finished
